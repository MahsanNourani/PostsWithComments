# PostsWithComments
Creates template posts using Mustache.js and bootstrap. Each post consists of an image, a text, profile picture of the person who created the post and his/her username. For each posts, there may be as many comments as desired.

I used this to run my user study in which I wanted to show the users a few posts with comments and wanted the users to rate each post!
